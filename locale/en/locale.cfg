[train-spawner-stop]
main-description=This is a [font=default-bold]train spawner stop[/font]. It will continuously create trains and immediately put them in automatic mode. You can customize the behavior here.
source-station-description=You can choose the [font=default-bold]source station[/font] here. When any train is parked at a source station, this spawner stop will create copies of it. If there are multiple source stops to choose from, the spawner will go through all of them in random order, including empty ones.
spawning-frequency-description=You can customzie the train [font=default-bold]spawning frequency[/font] here. Note that when the circuit network is used to trigger spawning trains, it is additional to this frequency, and is not kept track of. The total frequency and these settings are synchronized across all spawner stops with the same name.
spawning-frequency-option-by-intervals=Spawn at constant time intervals
spawning-frequency-option-by-rate=Spawn according to rate
spawning-frequency-randomize-intervals-toggle=Randomize intervals between trains
spawning-frequency-lookahead-toggle=Don't spawn a train if the signal immediately after the stop is red
spawning-frequency-skip-label=When a train cannot be spawned (for example, if the block is occupied):
spawning-frequency-skip-option-skip=Discard the attempt and carry on
spawning-frequency-skip-option-wait=Wait until the train can be spawned, then carry on
spawning-frequency-skip-option-queue=Carry on immediately, but remember the attempt and spawn the train whenever possible

[train-void-stop]
main-description=This is a [font=default-bold]train void stop[/font]. Use it to delete trains.
option-schedule=Delete only trains that arrive here by schedule
option-passthrough=Delete all trains that pass through this stop

[train-meter-stop]
main-description=This is a [font=default-bold]train meter stop[/font]. In addition to functioning as a normal train stop, it measures train throughput. Statistics are added together across meter stops with the same name.
reset-stop-stats-button=Reset statistics for this stop
reset-station-stats-button=Reset statistics for all stops with the same name
